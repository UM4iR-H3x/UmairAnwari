                <h1>What is Programming</h1>
                <p>Real software processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative, and
                    managerial activities with the overall goal of specifying, designing, implementing,
                    and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software
                    tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for supporting the editing of different
                    types of document and for managing the immense volume of detailed information
                    that is generated in a large software project.
                    The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are organized differently in different development processes. In the waterfall
                    model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are
                    interleaved. How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software,
                    people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example,
                    specifications are written on cards. Tests are executable and developed before the
                    program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.
                    Of course, for many compilers, the interpreter is a hardware unit that processes
                    machine instructions and the abstract machine is a real processor. However, for
                    dynamically typed languages, such as Python, the interpreter may be a software
                    component.
